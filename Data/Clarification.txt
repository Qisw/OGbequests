This code and its corresponding graphs give the percentage of bequests distributed among different age and income groups for the desired SCF survey years.

The graphs already included in this Data file are those corresponding to the years 1998-2013.

---HOW TO RUN CODE---
-navigate to where the file is located using the command prompt.
-use the following command "python SCFExtract.py <start year> <end year> <Whether you want graphs or not (True = want graphs, False = don't want graphs)>
- The desired start year must be 1989 or later because there are no SCF summary variables before this date.
- Currently (2015), there is no SCF later than 2013 so you cannot enter a end year later than 2013.
- In order for the code to run you must have the corresponding data files from the Federal Reserve's website. More information on how to gather this data in the file "HowToFindData.txt".
